# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the following icon files for building:

- icon.icns (for Mac) - 512x512px or higher
- icon.ico (for Windows) - 256x256px or higher  
- icon.png (for Linux) - 512x512px or higher

You can create these icons from a single high-resolution PNG file using online converters or tools like:
- Online: https://convertio.co/png-icns/ or https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-ico
- Mac: Use the built-in Preview app to export as .icns
- Windows: Use online converters for .ico files

For now, the build will work without icons (using default Electron icons).
